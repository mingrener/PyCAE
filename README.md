This is ***a local team environment*** meaning one file system for all instance users. An instance is contained inside a docker container (so only folders that you explicitly provide will be visible to it). 

Environment includes:
 - **CAD** tools: *pythonocc-core* and *CadQuery*
 - **FEM** tools: *fenics-dolfin*
 - **Visualization** tools: *pyvista*, *itkwidgets* (in-browser), *mayavi* (on-server)

Note that as any real CAE software docker image file is big and requires at least **17GB** 

## Install

### From Dockerhub
start
on 0.0.0.0 (localhost and public IP if node has one) 
on port 8890 (port can be changed)
with admin user password `Scientific`
with shared between users directory hosted on a host node `/full/path/to/a/shared/folder/`
```bash
docker run -d -p 8890:8892  -e USER_PASS=Scientific -v /full/path/to/a/shared/folder/:/opt/notebooks/ olejak/pycae:latest
```

### From source
1) get code:
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/spbuCAE/PyCAE/
cd PyCAE/
```
2) start building as a detached process:
```bash
nohup docker build -t spbu/cae:latest --squash . > build-logs.out 2>&1&
```
3) build takes time (1h+).
4) check build-logs.out:
```bash
tail build-logs.out
```
5) when build process have finished you shall see something like:
```bash
Removing intermediate container dccc972021d9
---> 513eafc3124f
Successfully built 3b4292862131
Successfully tagged spbu/cae:latest
```
6) start
on 0.0.0.0 (localhost and public IP if node has one) 
on port 8890 (port can be changed)
with admin user password `Scientific`
```bash
 docker run -d -p 8890:8892  -e USER_PASS=Scientific -d /full/path/to/a/shared/folder:/opt/notebook/ spbu/cae:latest
```

## Login
On navigating to it you shall see login screen:

Enter `admin` as login with `Scientific` password - this will bring you to the JupiterLab

## Add a new user
1) Login into an administrator
2) Go to `/tree` view (url like ``) open 
3) Add user to JupiterHub (needed for abilety to login)

4) Open a new termnal
5) Check that `sudo` works for you with
```
#will ask for user password e.g. Scientific
sudo ls
```
6) Add system user (needed for shared folder access)
```bash
sudo useradd --create-home --no-log-init --shell /bin/bash -g users test 
```
7) Provide user with login and JupyterHub website addres. On his first entrence what ever he will write as a `password` will be saved as his password.
